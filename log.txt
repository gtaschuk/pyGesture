What have I done?
- Tuned parameters to increase accuracy
- Redefined displacement as min point to max point (bounding box)
rather than first to last point
- started tracking variable len windows
- Added the minimum arc len
- Added error reporting in the debug window
- Refactored
-- better track error and 
-- simplified classification
-- changed hard coded values into class vars
- Started writing theory section
- began working on dynamic dtw
